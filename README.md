# Nyan
Nyan is a UwU-Speak version of `cat`. I wrote this after using [echowo](https://github.com/kokoscript/echowo) by kokoscript. Currently it is just kind of
a joke program but I do plan on adding a bit more to it down the line.

## Installation
Installation is pretty simple. You just do
```bash
git clone https://github.com/itst3k/nyan
cd nyan
make && sudo make install
```
Then to run it you just type `nyan`.

## But why?
Why not! Like I said this is basically a little joke program. Plus I made this to learn a bit more C++, which is... Silly... lol
